# External Wrench Estimation in Multi-rotor UAVs

Project for the first module of the Electives in Robotics / Control Problems in Robotics exam at Sapienza University of Rome.


An External Wrench Estimator implementation is proposed, this algorithm is described in 'Simultaneous Contact and Aerodynamic Force Estimation (s-CAFE) for Aerial Robots' ![paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12908).
A qudrotor is affected by wrenches generated by interaction forces and wind effects, the estimator estimate the total wrench but is not able to discriminate between Interaction and Aerodynamic forces, is implemented in Matlab and the Estimated External Wrench is used to compensate the effect by adding a correction term in the control input. Our paper, with a more detailed solution is available in the repository, together with a presentation in ppt. 
 

## Simulation Environment

The project consists of two main modules:

 the Matlab client application, implementing the core logic of the system
 
 the Coppelia simulation scene, providing the experimental environment and simulation settings


##  Computational Framework

The Matlab application is made up of three main classes:

- Quadrotor : implements the system dynamics and provides the control design for tracking task

- Aerodynamics : contains the wrench estimation algorithm and the contact detection procedure

- QuadrotorSim : acts as an interface between Matlab logic and Coppelia simulation environment

## Experiments

Two task trajectories are considered: a hovering and an elicoidal trajectory.

We tested the external wrench estimation and contact detection, in the following cases:


- in presence of wind action only
- in presence of a continuous contact action but in absence of wind action
- in presence of a continuous contact action and of wind action
- in presence of wind action and not uniformly distributed load mass
