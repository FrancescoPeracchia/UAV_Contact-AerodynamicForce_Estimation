# External Wrench Estimation in Multi-rotor UAVs

Multi-rotor flying robots are increasing their level of autonomy, flying under a variety of conditions, and this forced us to consider real-world situations. This class of robots is subject to local disturbances due to wind effects, collisions, or loss of propellers.
The external wrench (forces and torques) acting on flying robots can be interpreted as a sum of the aerodynamics wrench, the physical interaction wrench, and a fault wrench. Therefore, robust operation under wind influence typically would require additional sensors to discriminate between these constituent wrenches.
In this work we developed a trajectory tracking controller, described in [Simultaneous Contact and Aerodynamic Force Estimation (s-CAFE) for Aerial Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12908), to make a quadrotor performing a trajectory tracking task on two path classes: a hovering path and an elliptical path, under the action of external disturbances due to contact and aerodynamic forces. The External Wrench Estimator evaluates the total wrench but is not able to discriminate between interaction and aerodynamic forces, it is implemented in Matlab and it is used to compensate the effect by adding a correction term in the control input. 
 

## Simulation Environment

The project consists of two main modules:

- **Matlab client application**: implements the core logic of the system
 
- **Coppelia simulation scene**: provides the experimental environment and simulation settings


##  Computational Framework

The Matlab application is made up of three main classes:

- **Quadrotor**: implements the dynamic model and properties of the system and provides the control laws for trajectory tracking of the desired task trajectory

- **Aerodynamics**: contains the wrench estimation algorithm and the contact detection procedure

- **QuadrotorSim**: acts as an interface between Matlab logic and Coppelia simulation, managing the data communication between the two main modules and the project

## Modeling and Control
We modeled the system dynamics following the Lagrangian formalism. The cascaded control structure is composed of a position tracking controller and an attitude controller. The position controller tracks a desired position, velocity, and acceleration.
The required attitude R𝑑𝑖 is obtained from the desired angles φ, θ, ψ. The first two orientation angles are obtained by geometric inspection from the inertial control forces, while the last remains left to be controlled.

## Experiments

Two task trajectories are considered:
- a hovering task, tested with both wind and contact force actions
- an elicoidal trajectory tested with wind action only

We tested the external wrench estimation and contact detection, in the following cases:

- hovering trajectory + impulse force action [video1](https://github.com/FrancescoPeracchia/UAV_External-Wrench-Estimation-in-Multi-rotor-UAVs/blob/main/video/experiment-hovering%2B(down)impulse.mp4) [video2](https://github.com/FrancescoPeracchia/UAV_External-Wrench-Estimation-in-Multi-rotor-UAVs/blob/main/video/experiment-hovering%2B(left)impulse.mp4) [video3](https://github.com/FrancescoPeracchia/UAV_External-Wrench-Estimation-in-Multi-rotor-UAVs/blob/main/video/experiment-hovering%2B(right)impulse.mp4)
- hovering trajectory + wind action [video](https://github.com/FrancescoPeracchia/UAV_External-Wrench-Estimation-in-Multi-rotor-UAVs/blob/main/video/experiment-hovering%2Bwind.mp4)
- hovering trajectory + continuous force action [video](https://github.com/FrancescoPeracchia/UAV_External-Wrench-Estimation-in-Multi-rotor-UAVs/blob/main/video/experiment-hovering%2Bforce.mp4)
- hovering trajectory + wind action + continuous force action [video](https://github.com/FrancescoPeracchia/UAV_External-Wrench-Estimation-in-Multi-rotor-UAVs/blob/main/video/experiment-hovering%2Bwind%26force.mp4)
- hovering trajectory + wind action and not uniformly distributed load mass [video](https://github.com/FrancescoPeracchia/UAV_External-Wrench-Estimation-in-Multi-rotor-UAVs/blob/main/video/experiment-hovering%2Bwind%2Basymmetry.mp4)
- spirale trajectory + wind action [video1](https://github.com/FrancescoPeracchia/UAV_External-Wrench-Estimation-in-Multi-rotor-UAVs/blob/main/video/experiment-spirale%2Bwind%20(1).mp4) [video2](https://github.com/FrancescoPeracchia/UAV_External-Wrench-Estimation-in-Multi-rotor-UAVs/blob/main/video/experiment-spirale%2Bwind%20(2).mp4)

The **force vector** is indicated with a red line while the **wind torque** is indicated with a blue arrow with intensity and direction proportional to its dimension and norm.
During the simulation the online plot of the ground truth trajectory and the actual trajectory generated by the designed control and wrench estimation algorithm is shown.

## Weakenesses
The provided system for external wrench estimation is not complete since the module aimed at discriminating between aerodynamics and contact actions is missing. This is in particular due to the limits set by the simulation environment that prevented us to correctly perform the required empiric evaluation of the airspeed needed to fit a suitable model for the aerodynamic forces according to the blade flapping model.
